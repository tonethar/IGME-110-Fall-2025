## III. How do teams work?

- Allowable team size is 2 to 4 (*three* is probably ideal)  
- We're going to give you a chance to choose your own teams - there are 2 ways to approach this:

***1) Decide which infographic you want to implement as a working prototype, and then look for others that are interested***

OR

***2) Get your team together, and then as a group pick an infographic to implement***

- In either case, ***--->*** *head to your section specific Slack channel* ***&lt;---*** in our [IGME-110 Slack workspace](https://www.rit.edu/its/rit-enterprise-slack) ...
- ... you will see the current team membership, and the names of those still looking for a team ...
- ... once you have found a team, one team member should immediately post the team membership to the thread ...
- ... we need to know this so we can keep the membership list up to date ...
- ... anyone who does not have a team at the beginning of our week 10B meeting will be assigned a team at that time

## IV. FAQ
