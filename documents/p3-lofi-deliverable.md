# Project 3 - Interactive Digital Prototype - deliverable #2 (DRAFT)
## *Lo-Fi mockups and in-class testing*

---

## Prerequisites
- You should have defined the core functionality of your app, have at least 5 to 7 possible features in mind, and have defined at least 3 *user personas*

---

## I. Overview
- In class, your group will present a LoFi (wireframe) version of your Interactive Digital Prototype.
- The purpose of this LoFi version is to gather meaningful feedback from your users (classmates), which will inform concept and design improvements BEFORE you create a HiFi working prototype.
- Your group will also create a list of *use cases* designed to collect information on the usability, design, and concept of your project.

---

## II. Assignment Requirements
- 1. A minimum of 5 *User Flow Diagrams* that map out at least 5 distinct "journeys" that your users (the personas you created in deliverable #1) will have while attempting to accomplish their goals on your app
- 2. A *miniumum* of 3 screen mockups (LoFi):
  - the screen mockups should demonstrate the core idea of your project and should reflect:
    - the concept you are developing based on your selected infographic.
    - the core features that will help your audience interact with the project and have a successful "journey"
    - the initial design choices that will guide the final look and feel of the project
  - the mockups can be developed on paper, or digitally using tools such as canvas or Photoshop
  - here's an example of what paper mockups could look like --> [Mobile Application Design : Paper Prototype Video (1:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y20E3qBmHpg)
  - these mockups will be tested by your peers in class
- 3. Use cases and testing  - ***TODO***
