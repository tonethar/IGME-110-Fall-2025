# Project 3 - Interactive Digital Prototype - deliverable #2 (DRAFT)
## *Lo-Fi Version and in-class testing*

---

## I. Overview
- In class, your group will present a LoFi version of your Interactive Digital Prototype.
- The purpose of this LoFi version is to gather meaningful feedback from your classmates, which will help guide design improvements before creating a working prototype.
- Your group will also create a list of *use cases* designed to collect information on the usability, design, and concept of your project.
- This survey will help focus the feedback you receive and ensure that it addresses the most important aspects of your prototype.

## II. Assignment Requirements
- 1. LoFi Mockups:
- The prototype draft should be functional enough to demonstrate the core idea of your project. While it doesn’t need to be fully polished, it should reflect:
  - The concept you are developing based on your selected infographic.
  - The core features that will help your audience interact with the project.
  - The initial design choices that will guide the final look and feel of the project.
- This draft will be tested by your peers in class, so ensure it is accessible and ready to be interacted with.
- 2. Feedback Survey:
  - Your group will create a feedback survey to collect focused and actionable feedback from those who test your prototype. The survey should be designed to gather information on:
  - Usability: Is the prototype easy to navigate? Are there any confusing or unintuitive elements?

## III. Submission Requirements

- Submit both the prototype and the form to myCourses before the dropbox closes.
