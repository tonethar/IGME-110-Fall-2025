# Project 3 - Interactive Digital Prototype - deliverable #2
## Lo-Fi Version and in-class testing
- In class, your group will present the first draft of your Interactive Digital Prototype.
- The purpose of this draft is to gather meaningful feedback from your classmates, which will help guide design improvements before creating a working prototype.
In addition to the prototype draft, your group will create a list of *use cases* designed to collect information on the usability, design, and concept of your project.
This survey will help focus the feedback you receive and ensure that it addresses the most important aspects of your prototype.
Assignment Requirements:
- 1. LoFi Prototypes:
- The prototype draft should be functional enough to demonstrate the core idea of your project. While it doesn’t need to be fully polished, it should reflect:
  - The concept you are developing based on your selected infographic.
  - The core features that will help your audience interact with the project.
  - The initial design choices that will guide the final look and feel of the project.
- This draft will be tested by your peers in class, so ensure it is accessible and ready to be interacted with.
- 2. Feedback Survey:
Your group will create a feedback survey to collect focused and actionable feedback from those who test your prototype. The survey should be designed to gather information on:
  - Usability: Is the prototype easy to navigate? Are there any confusing or unintuitive elements? 
- Submit both the prototype and the form to myCourses before the dropbox closes.
