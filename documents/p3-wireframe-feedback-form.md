# P3 - Wireframe Feedback Form

**Instructions:**
- Paste the form below into a Word or Google Doc
- Make copies (digital or otherwise), one form per user
- The "faciliatator" will ask the questions and give directions to the user
- The "computer" will physically change the screens as the user attempts to perform tasks
- The "scribe" will complete the questions on this form
- Key Principles for Effective Wireframe Feedback:
  - Focus on 'Why': Use open-ended questions (starting with What, Why, How) to get rich, qualitative data. Avoid simple Yes/No answers where possible.
  - Non-Leading: Avoid language that suggests an answer (e.g., instead of "Was the simple layout easy to use?" ask "How was your experience using the layout?").
  - Post-Task: The most valuable feedback is often collected immediately after a user attempts a task, while the experience is fresh in their mind.
- Use the "Think Aloud" Protocol:
  - This is the most critical technique for discovery of missing features. Ask the user to verbalize every thought that comes to mind while they are interacting with the wireframe

### Task {Task Number}: {Specific Task Name/Goal}
1. *How easy was it to complete this task?* (1 = Very Difficult, 5 = Very Easy)

2. *Did you understand what to do at every step?* (Yes / No / Sometimes) *If no or sometimes, please briefly explain*:

3. *Were there any labels, icons, or words that were confusing or unclear?* 

4. *Did you hesitate or get stuck at any point? If so, where and why?*
