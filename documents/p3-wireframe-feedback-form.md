# P3 - Wireframe Feedback Feedback Form

**Instructions:**
- Paste the form below into a Word or Google Doc
- Make copies (digital or otherwise), one form per user
- The "faciliatator" will ask the questions and give directions to the user
- The "computer" will physically change the screens as the user attempts to perform tasks
- The "scribe" will complete the questions on this form
- Key Principles for Effective Wireframe Feedback:
  - Focus on 'Why': Use open-ended questions (starting with What, Why, How) to get rich, qualitative data. Avoid simple Yes/No answers where possible.
  - Non-Leading: Avoid language that suggests an answer (e.g., instead of "Was the simple layout easy to use?" ask "How was your experience using the layout?").
  - Post-Task: The most valuable feedback is often collected immediately after a user attempts a task, while the experience is fresh in their mind.
