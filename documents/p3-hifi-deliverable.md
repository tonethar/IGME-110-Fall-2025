## WEEK 12B: Hi-Fi Prototype Progress Check
**(In-Class Participation - 10% of P3 Grade)**

### Quick Overview

This is an **informal progress check** to ensure you're on track for final presentations.

**What's Happening in 12B:**
1. **Share your progress in Slack** before class (screenshot or link)
2. **Last 15-20 minutes:** Quick peer feedback with another team
3. **Rest of class:** Work time

**What You Need to Show:**
- At least 2-3 screens built in hi-fi
- Basic navigation working
- Consistent design started (colors, fonts)
- Clear plan for what's left to do

**No formal submission** - just participate in class and share progress in Slack.

---

### Peer Feedback (Last 15-20 Minutes of Class)

Get a second set of eyes to spot any last-minute concerns before final presentations.

**Simple Process:**
1. Pair with another team (5 min each team)
2. Show your current prototype
3. Get quick feedback: What's working? What's confusing? What to prioritize?

**No forms, no scripts** - just helpful conversation between teams.

### II. Group Presentation Requirements

**Time Limit: ~5 minutes per team**

Your group will pitch your digital prototype to the class as if presenting to stakeholders or investors. Show off what you built and your process!

#### Presentation Structure:

**Important: All team members must speak during the presentation for full credit.** How you divide the sections is up to your team - be strategic about who presents what based on strengths and contributions.

**Suggested Structure (~5 minutes total):**

**1. Introduction & Problem (1 min)**
- Introduce team members
- State app name and core problem you're solving
- Identify your target audience (reference personas)

**2. Research & Design Evolution (1-2 min)**
- Show the original app proposal/infographic that inspired you
- Brief walkthrough of design evolution:
  - 1-2 lo-fi screens → corresponding hi-fi screens
  - How feedback from testing improved the design

**3. Live Demo (2-3 min)** ⭐ **MAIN FOCUS**
- Walk through 2-3 core user flows
- Show key interactive elements in action
- Explain navigation and main features
- Highlight your best design decisions

**4. Testing & Iteration (1 min)**
- Brief overview of testing process (lo-fi and 12B peer feedback)
- Share 2-3 specific improvements from user feedback:
  - "Users couldn't find X, so we added Y"
  - "Navigation was confusing, so we changed Z"

**5. Conclusion (30 sec)**
- Summarize project impact
- "Imagine if..." statement about the app's potential
- Thank the audience and invite questions

**How to Divide Presentation Duties:**

Your team has flexibility in how you organize this. Here are some approaches:

**Option A: By Project Phase**
- Person 1: Intro + Research (sections 1-2)
- Person 2: Demo (section 3)
- Person 3: Testing + Conclusion (sections 4-5)

**Option B: By Role**
- Project Manager: Intro + Conclusion
- Design/Developer: Demo + Design decisions
- Tester: Research context + Feedback/iteration

**Option C: Equal Rotation**
- Each person presents 2 sections
- Rotate who's speaking every 1-2 minutes

**The key:** Make sure transitions between speakers are smooth and everyone contributes meaningfully.

---

#### Presentation Best Practices:

**Do:**
- ✅ **Practice together multiple times!** (timing is critical)
- ✅ Test prototype beforehand - have backup screenshots ready
- ✅ Use slides for context, but focus demo time on the prototype
- ✅ Speak clearly and show enthusiasm for your project
- ✅ Have smooth transitions between speakers
- ✅ Know the ENTIRE project, not just your role (for Q&A)

**Don't:**
- ❌ Read from slides word-for-word
- ❌ Spend too long on context - get to the demo!
- ❌ Apologize for what's not done - focus on what works!
- ❌ Let one person dominate - everyone should speak
- ❌ Wing it - practice prevents disasters

---

## Remember

You already did the hard work of **discovering problems** with lo-fi testing. That's where real learning happened - you found missing features, confusing navigation, and usability issues when they were easy to fix.

Now your job is to:
1. **Build** a polished version that addresses what you learned
2. **Show** your process and final product with confidence

You've got this! Show us what you built!

# Project 3 - Interactive Digital Prototype - deliverable #3 (DRAFT)
## *Hi-Fi Version and in-class testing*

---

## I. Overview
- In class, your group will present the current draft of your digital prototype.
- This draft should be interactive enough to allow others to test its core functionality and design elements.
- The purpose of this draft is to gather meaningful feedback from your classmates, which will help guide improvements before submitting the final version.
- In addition to the prototype draft, your group will create a qualitative feedback survey designed to collect information on the usability, design, and concept of your project. This survey will help focus the feedback you receive and ensure that it addresses the most important aspects of your prototype.

---

## II. Assignment Requirements
### A. Prototype Draft
- The prototype draft should be functional enough to demonstrate the core idea of your project. While it doesn’t need to be fully polished, it should reflect:
  - the concept you are developing based on your selected infographic
  - the core features that will help your audience interact with the project
  - the initial design choices that will guide the final look and feel of the project
- This draft will be tested by your peers in class, so ensure it is accessible and ready to be interacted with.

### B. User Testing
- Have a minimum of FIVE users test your group's application
- Each user will TODO 

### C. Feedback Survey
- Your group will create a feedback survey to collect focused and actionable feedback from those who test your prototype. The survey should be designed to gather information on:
  - **Usability**: Is the prototype easy to navigate? Are there any confusing or unintuitive elements?
  - **Design**: How effective are the visual and interactive elements? Does the design align with the goals of the project?
  - **Concept**: Is the core idea clear and well-executed? Does the prototype address the problem or message from your selected infographic?
  - **Missing Features**: Ask the "Magic Wand" question again
- This survey should include a mix of open-ended questions and scaled responses (e.g., Likert scale)
  - make sure the questions are clear, concise, and focus on areas where feedback will be most helpful
  - the survey must have between 5 and no more than 8 questions in total
  - create the survey using Google Forms
  - be prepared to share the link with your classmates during the feedback session

---

## III. Submission
- Submit both the prototype and the public ("All of RIT") link to the feedback form to myCourses before the dropbox closes.
- Note: if the prototype is written in Figma or Google Slides, you will submit a working link that is public
