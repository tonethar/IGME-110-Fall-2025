# Project 3 - Interactive Digital Prototype - deliverable #3 (DRAFT)
## *Hi-Fi Version and in-class testing*

---

## I. Overview
- In class, your group will present the current draft of your digital prototype.
- This draft should be interactive enough to allow others to test its core functionality and design elements.
- The purpose of this draft is to gather meaningful feedback from your classmates, which will help guide improvements before submitting the final version.
- In addition to the prototype draft, your group will create a feedback survey designed to collect information on the usability, design, and concept of your project. This survey will help focus the feedback you receive and ensure that it addresses the most important aspects of your prototype.

## II. Assignment Requirements
### Prototype Draft
- The prototype draft should be functional enough to demonstrate the core idea of your project. While it doesnâ€™t need to be fully polished, it should reflect:
  - The concept you are developing based on your selected infographic.
  - The core features that will help your audience interact with the project.
  - The initial design choices that will guide the final look and feel of the project.
This draft will be tested by your peers in class, so ensure it is accessible and ready to be interacted with.

### Feedback Survey
- Your group will create a feedback survey to collect focused and actionable feedback from those who test your prototype. The survey should be designed to gather information on:
  - Usability: Is the prototype easy to navigate? Are there any confusing or unintuitive elements?
  - Design: How effective are the visual and interactive elements? Does the design align with the goals of the project?
  - Concept: Is the core idea clear and well-executed? Does the prototype address the problem or message from your selected infographic?
- Your survey should include a mix of open-ended questions and scaled responses (e.g., Likert scale). Make sure the questions are clear, concise, and focus on areas where feedback will be most helpful. Create the survey using Google Forms, be prepared to share the link with your classmates during the feedback session.

## III. Submission
- Submit both the prototype and the form to myCourses before the dropbox closes.
  - note: if the prototype is written in Figma or Google Slides, you will submit a working link that is public
