# Figma: First App

## I. Pre-requisites
- We have already done some or all of this part in-class together, if you missed it, here are the instructions:
  - **Teaching Guide:** https://github.com/jptweb/IGME-110-Fall-2025/blob/main/documents/teaching-guide-figma.md
  - **Video Tutorial:** [YouTube link - mirrors the in-class demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1UKB-0EUhQ)
- Complete the basic prototype following the guide/video above before moving on to the enhancements below

---

## II. Assignment Requirements

Complete **ONE** of the following options:

### Option A: Enhance the Class Prototype

Build on what you created above by completing **both** of the requirements below:

#### 1. Add One Additional Interaction
Be creative! Choose at least one enhancement to add (you may do several if you wish):
- Create another page opened by clicking a button
- Add a scrollable area
- Create a modal popup
- Add an animation or transition

> Make an honest effort to add something interesting and functional.

#### 2. Increase Design Fidelity
Transform the basic prototype into a **medium-fidelity** design:
- Add brand colors and improve the color scheme
- Include images or icons
- Refine typography
- Add visual polish (recall CRAP principles from earlier in the course)
- **Maintain consistency across all pages**

---

### Option B: Create Your Own Prototype

Build an original prototype from scratch that includes **all** of these elements:
- **At least 3 interactive pages** (buttons, links, or other interactions connecting pages)
- **At least 1 scrollable element**
- **Medium-fidelity design** (more polished than a wireframe)
- **Consistent visual design** throughout all pages

> This option may take a little more work but will give you much more practice using Figma. If you have a vision you want to execute from scratch, this may be a good option to pick.

## III. Submission Instructions

Submit to the myCourses dropbox:

### 1. Your Figma Link
- Click the blue **"Share"** button (top-right corner of Figma)
- Set permissions to **"Anyone with the link can view"**
- **Test your link** in an incognito/private browser window before submitting

### 2. Reflection Response (in the dropbox comments)

Answer both questions:

**a) What did you add/create?** 

Describe exactly what you did so I can grade your work. Be specific.
- *Example: "I added a third modal that appears when you click the taser icon and displays 'Zap!' with a yellow background."*
- *Example: "I created a new Settings page with a scrollable list of options and linked it to the footer navigation."*

⚠️ **You will not receive credit if you don't explain what you added.**

**b) What are your thoughts on Figma as a prototyping tool?**  
Share your initial impressions—what did you like? What was challenging?
