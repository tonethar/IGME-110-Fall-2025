### Step #1 - User Flow (part of deliverable #2)
- what is it that people are trying to get done?
- map out the journey from when they land on your site (experience, app etc) until their key objective is achieved
- create user flow diagrams

### Step #2 - Wireframing (LoFi prototype, part of deliverable #2)
- From the user flow diagram, create corresponding screens or pages
- Each page or screen contributes to reaching that key objective
- Shopping example: store page, product page, payment page, success page 
- Create wireframes for each page, either on paper or digitally (canva or similar app)
- Get inspired by similar apps or web pages that you already use
- Experiment with different UI elements and try to create the most seamless user experience
- Also try out different layouts
- All of the above in steps #1 & #2 is UX (User Experience) Design

### Step #3 - Design System (HiFi prototype, part of deliverable #3)
- Decide on visual style for the UI Design
- You need to have consistent & reusable elements that fit you chosen style:
  - colors & fonts
  - icons
  - text (sizes: small, body, label, title)
  - buttons, inputs, cards and other UI widgets
- Links:

### Step #4 - Actual Building/Designing of Interactive Prototype (part of deliverable #3)
- Visual Hierarchy - show order of importance among elements
- Contrast - keep elements distinct and enable readability/accessibility
- Balance - moderates spacing, alignment and placement of elements
- Consistency - keep elements harmonious and avoid user confusion
- Simplicity - keep things clear and straightforward for users
- Feedback - keep users engaged and gives them a clear reaction to their actions
- also:
  - use actual content when possible, not placeholders
  - add illustrations and visuals
