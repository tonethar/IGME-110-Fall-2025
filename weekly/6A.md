# Week 6A

## I. *The Medium is the message*

- *"The medium is the message" is a phrase coined by the Canadian communication theorist Marshall McLuhan and the name of the first chapter in his [Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man](https://mcluhan.org/understanding-media/), published in 1964. McLuhan proposes that a communication medium itself, not the messages it carries, should be the primary focus of study.*

### Discussion Questions

- *Do you think McLuhan would consider movies and television to be a comparable medium to online videos? Why or why not?* (from Study Guide)
  - let's consider some characteristics of media:
      - how are they distributed? (time, space)
      - where do we consume them?
      - are they personal or communal?
      - created by professionals or anyone? (any barriers to entry?)
      - how does the end user "participate"?
  - first ... in-person oral performances --> books/newspapers --> radio --> movies --> broadcast television --> cable television - how are these media distinct?
  - next ... television vs. YouTube
- Episodic content (the old standard on Network TV) v. Serialized content (defacto mode on NetFlix)?
- Dribbled out over time, or released all at once?
- TicTok/YouTube Shorts? Streaming? Podcasts?
- Media Evolution/Deeper Questions - [what did we miss?](https://g.co/gemini/share/de9e1281fed0)
