## III. Creating Effective Visualizations

### III-A. Survey Data Presentation Refactor

- [Youtube: How to Visualize Demographic Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K7m4plOiuc) (03:36)
- Identify the following and indicate either 👍 or 👎 or 😐 for the example from the video:
  - wall of text / list layout
  - grid layout
  - 4 distinct elements
  - single color for text and graphics
  - text only (no graphics)
  - text and graphics (donut chart, histogram, icons)
  - text all the same size
  - non-technical / no-jargon text

### III-B. Climate Change Bulletpoint Makeover 

- [From bullet points to data visualizations: 5 data design makeover ideas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqgkqibkTXo)
- #1 - What makes the first makeover effective? How do the image, fonts, text size, icons and colors work together and show a very intentional design?
- #2 - Answer the above questions again for the second makeover, and why is the icon array effective here? Could you think of another way to visualize this? Also, do you see any issues with the slide that detract from its effectiveness?
- #3 - The third makeover also uses an icon array - although it doesn't work so well at showing increases - a bar or line chart would work better
- #4 - The fourth makeover also uses a donut chart
- #5 - What new technique is used on the 5th slide that makes it particularly effective?
