## III. In-class group exercise - *Paper Prototype of a Digital Game*

- Take a peek at *Paper Simulations of Digital Games* - see PDF of Slides in myCourses
- Also - more discussion of MDA (Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics) if you are interested:
  - https://game-developers.org/info/uploads/2022/09/MDAFramework.pdf
  - https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/revisiting-the-mda-framework
- As a group, pick a game to paper prototype - no duplicates in each section, please - https://wheelofnames.com/tr5-h7j
- Think about the eight kinds of fun - https://gnomestew.com/the-eight-types-of-fun/
- Identify a Core Experience that this paper prototype will address
  - you can use the doo-dads, gimcracks, cards and paper on the back table - plus a pencil and whatever else you have at hand
- Of course, use Gen AI to do some brainstorming [Gemini - Mario Kart Board Game Comcept](https://gemini.google.com/share/d3785c866884)
- We will break 20-minutes before the end of class and every group will demo their prototype
- Get the credit you deserve - post a message to your section-specific Slack channel, in the thread named *Paper Prototype of Digital Game In-class Exercise - REPLY HERE* - be sure to give us the following (one post per team, before midnight tonight):
  - 1 --> the names of your group members
  - 2 --> at least 2 pictures of your game
  - 3 --> briefly discuss - a) the time scale of the game (slow, real-time, fast), b) the actions (choices) your players can take, c) the emotions you hope they feel and d) at least one emergent aspect of the game as it is played (dynamics)
