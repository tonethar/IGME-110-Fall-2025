# Week 11B

- Today you will be meeting with other teams and testing their P3 prototypes - here is the team info for all the teams  (who they are, what they are building) --> [P3 Teams](../documents/p3-teams.md)
- Right now, one person from each team, get a piece of paper off of the back table, write your team number and project name on it in large letters, and place it near where you will be testing your app so it is visible to others

## I. In-class testing of LoFi prototypes - Today's Process

- Let's review the roles and steps the "testing team" must go though to test their app
  - roles: *Facilitator*, *Computer*, *Scribe*
 
### Process
- #1 - all teams will meet for 5 minutes to get organized:
  - clarify who is performing each role, "extra" team members should be assigned to help with a specific role
  - (*Computer*) organize and prepare your screen printouts so that you will be able to quickly present them to the user as they interact with the app
  - (*Scribe*) be ready to record the results (probably in a shared google doc) - one document per user that is testing the app
- #2 - Each group will be paired with another (see "matchmaking" below) so that each group is paired with one or more other groups
- #3 - For 15 to 20 minutes, team "A" (the testers) will have members of team "B" (the users) attempt the 5 tasks that are detailed in team A's testing script, one user at a time
  - there is probably NOT enough time to be able to have every member of the other team test the app, that's OK, focus on the *quality* of your tests, not the *quantity*
- #4 - Now have the entire teams meet and do a 5-minute debrief about team "A's" app (ease of interactions, have the core use cases been implemented, etc) - the "Scribe" will record all of this
- #5 - After 15 minutes, reverse roles so now team 2 has team 1 attempt some of there tasks
Debrief




## II. Team matchmaking (by section)


### Section 04 (MW 5:00-6:15PM)

- LoFi prototypes for teams #1-#4 shall be tested FIRST, by the members of teams #5-#7
- After 30-minutes, the teams will switch roles


### Section 05 (MW 6:30-7:45PM)
- LoFi prototypes for teams #1-#4 shall be tested FIRST, by the members of teams #5-#8
- After 30-minutes, the teams will switch roles

### Section 06 (TR 5:00-6:15PM)
- LoFi prototypes for teams #1-#3 shall be tested FIRST, by the members of teams #4-#7
- After 30-minutes, the teams will switch roles

### Section 09 (TR 3:30-4:45PM)
- LoFi prototypes for teams #1-#4 shall be tested FIRST, by the members of teams #5-#9
- After 30-minutes, the teams will switch roles

## III. Deliverable
- (FIVE) completed scripts, one per user, detailing the results of the 5 tasks your users attempted, as well as the pre-task and post-task questions they were asked. If you were not able to get five users to test you app during the class, you will find some volunteers later on after class. Be sure to indicate on the script which users were from outside of class
- (ONE) Summary document:
  - The results of the debrief (see #4 above)
  - Any obvious improvements you can make, or missing features you can add to the app for the next deleiverable (the Hi-Fidelity working prototype!) 
- See myCourses for due date

## IV. What are we doing next week and the week after?

- 12A - after considering the feedback you received into your LoFi prototype, go ahead and get started implementing a High Fidelity (Hi Fi) working app in tools such as Figma, PowerPoint/Google Slides
  - you are now at Step #3 and [Step #4 of the UI/UX Design process](10B.md#step-3---design-system-hifi-prototype-part-of-deliverable-3) we covered last week - so you need to be using consistent colors, fonts, icons, graphics and UI elements
- 12B - test initial version of HiFi App
- 13A - as a group, present completed app to class
