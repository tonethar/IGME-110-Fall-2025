# Week 11B

- Today you will be meeting with other teams and testing their P3 prototypes - here is the team info for all the teams  (who they are, what they are building) --> [P3 Teams](../documents/p3-teams.md)
- Right now, one person from each team, get a piece of paper off of the back table, write your team number and project name on it in large letters, and place it near where you will be testing your app so it is visible to others

---

## I. In-class testing of LoFi prototypes - Today's Process

- Let's review the roles and steps the "testing team" must go though to test their app
  - roles: *Facilitator*, *Computer*, *Scribe*
 
### Process
- #1 - all teams will meet for 5 minutes to get organized:
  - clarify who is performing each role, "extra" team members should be assigned to help with a specific role
  - (*Computer*) organize and prepare your screen printouts so that you will be able to quickly present them to the user as they interact with the app
  - (*Scribe*) be ready to record the results (probably in a shared google doc) - one document per user that is testing the app
- #2 - Each group will be paired with another (see "matchmaking" below) so that each group is paired with one or more other groups
- #3 - For 15 to 20 minutes, team "A" (the testers) will have members of team "B" (the users) attempt the 5 tasks that are detailed in team A's testing script, one user at a time
  - there is probably NOT enough time to be able to have every member of the other team test the app, that's OK, focus on the *quality* of your tests, not the *quantity*
- #4 - Now have the entire teams meet and do a 5-minute debrief about team "A's" app (ease of interactions, have the core use cases been implemented, missing features etc) - the *Scribe* will record all of this
- #5 - Reverse roles so now team B has the members of team A attempt the tasks on their LoFi prototype

## III. 11B Deliverable - ONE submission per team
- (THREE) completed scripts, one per user, detailing the results of the 5 tasks your users attempted, as well as the pre-task and post-task questions they were asked
  - if you were not able to get three users to test your app during the class, you will find some volunteers later on after class
  - be sure to indicate on the script which users were from outside of class
- (ONE) Summary document, with the following contents:
  - The results of the debrief (see #4 in the Process, above)
  - Any obvious improvements the team can make to the app to improve the user experience
  - Potential missing features the team can add to the app
  - Which features the team will be attempting to implement for the next deliverable (the first draft of the Hi-Fidelity working prototype, which due in-class next week 12B!) 
- See myCourses for due date

## IV. What are we doing next week and the week after?

- 12A - after considering the feedback you received into your LoFi prototype, go ahead and get started implementing a High Fidelity (Hi Fi) working app in tools such as Figma, PowerPoint/Google Slides:
  - you are now at [Step #3 and Step #4 of the UI/UX Design process](10B.md#step-3---design-system-hifi-prototype-part-of-deliverable-3) we covered last week - so you need to be using consistent colors, fonts, icons, graphics and UI elements
  - ***\*\*POWER TIP\*\**** - get started on HiFi version prior to our 12A class meeting!
  - The designated *Prototype Developer* would be the one who takes point on that!
- 12B - HiFi version due prior to class meeting - test this initial version of HiFi App
- 13A - as a group, present completed HiFi app to rest of class
