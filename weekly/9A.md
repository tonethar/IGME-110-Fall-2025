## III.  Building Interactive Stuff
- A little humor --> [YouTube: Microsoft Re-Designs the iPod Packaging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUXnJraKM3k)
- You don't usually get a blank slate to work on - a real-world constraint is existing *branding*:
  - RIT Branding - https://www.rit.edu/brandportal/
  - Apple's HIG - https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/
  - Microsoft - https://microsoft.design/resources/
  - Google's Material Design - https://m3.material.io/
- Understanding your users - Research:
  - *Attitudinal vs Behavioral: This distinction can be summed up by contrasting "what people say" versus "what people do"  - very often the two are quite different*
- Understanding your users - Testing
  - Note that the testing method varies depending on where we are in the product-development stage: Strategize/Define Product, Design/Improve Usability or Launch/Assess
- Understanding your users - Personas
  - *A persona is a fictional, yet realistic, description of a typical or target user of the product. A persona is an archetype instead of an actual living human, but personas should be described as if they were real people*
- Building without a blueprint - the Winchester Mystery House:
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_Mystery_House
  - *The Winchester Mystery House, built by the widow of the man who invented the Winchester rifle. The plans were related to her by a medium from the spirits of the Indians killed by Winchester rifles, not by an architect. Sarah Winchester had builders working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for 38 years. Hence you get a house with ten kitchens, stairs to nowhere, tiny spiral staircases, and rooms with no doors.*

- How do you create blueprints for interactive media?
  - Instead of starting with a *site map*, you will most likely start with a *user flow diagram* that shows how a user will interact with a product. Example for someone landing on an  web site for exploring designs:
    - ***Land on main page of site*** -> ***Learn How it Works*** -> ***Find Category*** -> ***Select Category*** -> ***View Design Inspirations***
  - Then you might have a *Site Map* for a digital app, and for a physical product it might be a diagram showing all the states of the product
  - Then Wireframes (Lo-Fi Page Design) - tools:
    - Pencil & Paper
    - [Google Slides = App Prototype](https://medium.com/@gkulowiec/google-slides-app-prototype-23e5d4b76e92)
    - HTML pages - linked together - with some simple JavaScript for additional Interactivity
    - Real-time UI collaboration tools
      - Figma
      - Balsamiq
      - Miro
      - Axure
- Prototyping/Testing
  - Pro Tip #1: Good design is user-centric
    - https://about.google/intl/en_us/philosophy/
  - Pro Tip #2: You are not the user
  - Pro Tip #3: It can always be better

## IV. Introduction to User Experience (UX) & Interaction Design

- Here's the slideshow we'll look at today with the same information as below, but with some visual elements: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13xpDuO9XmoS9RJmCUr37Ir8j7uPLeXhY/

### Why This Matters Now
You've actually been doing UX work all semester without realizing it:
- **P1 (App Proposal):** You identified user problems and defined target audiences
- **P2 (Infographic):** You designed information to be understood by specific users
- **P3 (Prototype - next week):** You'll design HOW users actually interact with your app

### Common Design Mistakes to Avoid
❌ Designing for yourself instead of your users

❌ Assuming everyone thinks like you

❌ Adding features YOU want instead of what users need

Your job: Design for someone else's needs, test if it works for them, remove your own bias

### Tools UX Designers Use
We'll explore these more in P3, but here's what they are:

**Personas** - Detailed profiles of who your users are
- Example: Not just "college students" but "20-year-old commuter student who works part-time and struggles with time management"

**Sitemaps** - Show how information/pages are organized
- Like a family tree for your app or website
- Helps you see if navigation makes sense

**Wireframes** - Low-fidelity sketches showing layout and structure
- Focus on "where things go" not "how things look"
- Often just boxes and lines - no color, no final fonts

**Mockups** - High-fidelity visual designs
- This is what your infographics are - mockups!
- Shows actual colors, fonts, images

**Prototypes** 
THIS IS NEXT WEEKS TOPIC!
- Clickable/interactive versions you can test
- Users can click through and try to complete tasks
- Helps you find problems BEFORE you build the real thing

**Remember:** It can always be better! Professional designers go through many rounds of feedback and revision.
