## II. What's Happening Next Class (12B)

**Progress Check via Slack + Quick Peer Feedback**

Before next class:
- **Share your progress in Slack** (screenshot or link to your prototype)
- Shows accountability and lets everyone see what teams are building

In class:
- **Last 15-20 minutes:** Get feedback from another team (quick look, spot concerns)
- **Rest of class:** Work time

**What you need to show:**
- At least 2-3 screens built
- Basic navigation working
- Consistent design started

**No formal submission** - just share in Slack and participate in class.

## III. Today's Focus: BUILD

Entire class is work time. By Thursday, you need progress to show.

**Full instructions:** [P3 - Deliverables #3A & #3B: Final Prototype & Presentation](../documents/p3-hifi-deliverable.md)

**Get started:** - Some of this was hopefully already decided but just in case:
- Pick your tool (Figma, PowerPoint, etc.)
- Choose colors and fonts (if not done yet)
- Build your most important screens first
- **Get at least 1 screen done today**

**Reality check:** Leave today with something built, not just planned.

## IV. Tools & Resources

**Recommended Tools:**
- **Figma** - [figma.com](https://figma.com) (best for prototyping, free for students)
- **Google Slides/PowerPoint** - Use hyperlinks to connect slides
- **Canva** - [canva.com](https://canva.com) (easier learning curve)

**Need Help?**
- Ask me or your classmates
- Check Figma tutorials: [figma.com/resources/learn-design](https://www.figma.com/resources/learn-design/)
- Look at examples from other teams (inspiration, not copying!)

---

## V. Looking Ahead

**Thursday (12B):**
- Submit your hi-fi draft before class
- Quick peer feedback session (20-30 min)
- More work time

**Next Week (13A - Tuesday Nov 19):**
- **PRESENTATION DAY!**
- Final prototype due
- 5-7 minute presentation + Q&A
- All team members must speak

**Start thinking about your presentation NOW!** Don't wait until the last minute.
